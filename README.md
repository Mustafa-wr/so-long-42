# so-long-42
so long is another programming project at 42 that involves writing a game in C using the minilibx library. The goal of the game is to move a character through a maze to collect items while avoiding obstacles. The so long project requires you to implement game mechanics, graphics, and user input handling. It is a relatively long project that tests your ability to write modular and maintainable code and provides a valuable opportunity to practice using the minilibx library and game development concepts in C.
